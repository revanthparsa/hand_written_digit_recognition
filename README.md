After 3 runs of the splits the hyperparameter that is max depth varying from 1 to 15
- for first and second run max depth is 10 and model is overfitting because the train accuracy is 97%
- for third run the max depth is 9 and the train accuracy is 95% so the model is still overfitting 
- The f1 score is the best metric because the values are not same in all the cases
